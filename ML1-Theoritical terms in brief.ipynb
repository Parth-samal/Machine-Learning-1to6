    "#### Answer: Training Set- In Machine Learning, a training set is a dataset used to train a model. In training the model, specific features are picked out from the training set. These features are then incorporated into the model. Thereby, if the training set is labeled correctly, the model should be able to learn something from these features. Test Set- The test set is a dataset used to measure how well the model performs at making predictions on that test set. If the prediction scores for the test set are unreasonable, weâ€™ll have to make some adjustments to our model and try again."

In this method the dataset splits into two section, testing and training datasets, the testing dataset will only test the model while, in training dataset, the datapoints will come up with the model."
